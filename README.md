# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Overview of Project

Steve wants the stock dataset to expand to include the entire stock market over the last two years. 

### Purpose

Since the dataset will eventually expand to thousands of rows, the VBA code needs to be refactored to loop through all the data at one time. 
To determine if the refactoring is successful, the run times of the refactored VBA script need to be compared to the original VBA script.


### Results
The refactored code does produce small gains in efficiency.

###Summary
The advantage of refactoring code is I did not see any. It was minor tweaks in code that required a lot of effort for small gains.
The disadvantage was in refactoring code figuring out how to best refactor the code
